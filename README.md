# Elephant Train Collision Prevention System Documentation
---
<br>

## Introduction
<br>

>### The main objective of developing this system is to provide the train drivers with a monitoring interface for train drivers and other interested parties, so that they are able to take necessary action when some threats are identified. Threat in the sense, means something harmful to the elephants. For an example in Sri Lanka, the collisions between elephants and trains have been a huge problem that needs fixing. By using this platform threats like elephants' presence in the railtrack and elephants' moving directions can be easily monitored and then necessary actions can be taken to reduce the potential damage that can be caused by issues.
